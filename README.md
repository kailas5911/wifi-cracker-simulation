# 🔐 Wi-Fi Cracker Simulation (Educational Project)

This project is a **simulation of a dictionary attack** on a Wi-Fi password.  
⚠️ Note: This is **for educational purposes only** and does not hack real Wi-Fi networks.

---

## 📌 How it Works
- Reads possible passwords from `wordlist.txt`
- Tries each password one by one
- Stops when the correct password is found
- Demonstrates why **weak passwords** are dangerous

## 🚀 Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wifi-cracker-simulation.git
